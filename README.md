# odd-or-even
A short program which will tell the user if their entered number is odd or even.

## Odd or Even How-To:
1. Copy code into any IDE supporting Python.
2. Run code, this will than give you options (through input statements) where you will enter your number.
- When answering the input questions, entering a number must be answered as an integer (1, 10, 15, etc.).
- When the question contains (y/n) answer using y or n. y = Yes, n = No.
